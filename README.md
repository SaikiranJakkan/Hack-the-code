Applets are small Internet-based program written in Java, a programming language for the Web and can be downloaded by any computer. The applet is also capable of running in HTML. The applet is usually embedded in an HTML page on a Web site and can be executed from within a browser. After an applet arrives on the client, it has limited access to resources so that it can produce a graphical user interface and run complex computations without introducing the risks of viruses or data security breaching.
