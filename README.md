Multithreading in java is a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU.
Multithreaded applications are where two or more threads run concurrently; hence it is also known as Concurrency in Java. This multitasking is done, when multiple processes share common resources like CPU, memory, etc.
Each thread runs parallel to each other. Threads don't allocate separate memory area; hence it saves memory. Also, context switching between threads takes less time.
